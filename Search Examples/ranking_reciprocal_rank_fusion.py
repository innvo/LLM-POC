#  Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is an algorithm that evaluates the search scores from multiple, previously ranked results to produce a unified result set. In Azure AI Search, RRF is used whenever there are two or more queries that execute in parallel. Each query produces a ranked result set, and RRF is used to merge and homogenize the rankings into a single result set, returned in the query response. Examples of scenarios where RRF is always used include hybrid search and multiple vector queries executing concurrently.
